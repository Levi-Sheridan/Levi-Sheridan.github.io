I'm a mechanical engineer who recently graduated from Cooper Union, specializing in hardware development and manufacturing optimization. My work spans mechanical and electrical engineering, from CAD and prototyping to PCB design and system integration.

Most recently, I co-founded and served as hardware lead at Lever Labs, an educational robotics startup. I led complete hardware development of Pip, an educational robot for K-8 classrooms, optimizing for cost and manufacturability through multiple design iterations. I coordinated production with contract manufacturers in China and successfully piloted the robot with 25+ students.

Previously, I interned at SpaceX's foundry where I developed automation systems that generated over $500K in annual cost savings. I've also designed competition-winning autonomous combat robots. Beyond professional work, I document technical projects on YouTube, covering robotics, 3D printing, and investment casting.

I'm a builder at heart, driven by curiosity, a love for challenging problems, and a deep need to create things that help people and make the world better. I want to build hardware that people love using: products that are beautiful, solve real problems, and genuinely make their lives better. 

I'm currently seeking hardware engineering opportunities where I can apply my multidisciplinary expertise. Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn.
